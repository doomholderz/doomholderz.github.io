        Pragmatic Container Security</h1>
        <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
        <p>This is a guide for pragmatically improving your container
        security capabilities, with guidance on all tenets of container
        security.</p>
        <p>Great effort has been made to zero-in on the
        highest-impacting controls to reduce risk associated with
        container workloads, providing a practical roadmap for
        implementing strong container security.</p>
        <p>Each recommendation will be supplemented with: how to
        implement; what risk is <em>actually</em> mitigated through
        implementing; further steps you can take to mature this control
        (where appropriate).</p>
        <h3 id="wtf-is-container-security">WTF <em>is</em> Container
        Security</h3>
        <p>The <em>tl;dr</em> is that container security is our software
        supply-chain security.</p>
        <p>The <em>l;r</em> is that container security is the practice
        of ensuring that we are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Building secure container images</li>
        <li>Securing container pipelines</li>
        <li>Securing container registries</li>
        <li>Building and maintaining secure container deployment
        environments</li>
        <li>Enforcing secure container runtimes</li>
        <li>Monitoring our containers for security incidents</li>
        <li>Securing container orchestration tools used to manage
        containers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-to-use-this-guide">How to use this Guide</h3>
        <p>This guide will be split into the specific domains of
        container security:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Container image security (coming later)</p></li>
        <li><p>Container registry security (coming later)</p></li>
        <li><p>Container runtime security
        <code>(coming soon)</code></p></li>
        <li><p>Container monitoring (coming later)`</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Included in each recommendation will be steps to implement
        for Docker deployment of containers, and Kubernetes
        deployments.</p>
        <p>It’s recommended to audit your adherence to all requirements
        listed, and then work through the gaps systematically. Or just
        free-wheel it, different strokes I guess…</p>
