        Engineering at Google: My Interview Study Notes - nolang</a> is
        a great write up of some of the core technical interview
        questions that’ll be asked across most security engineer
        interviews, definitely useful if you’re trying to find areas of
        weakness to flesh out during interview season</li>

        <p>This was a hectic week both professionally and personally, so
        unfortunately the throughput for project work was limited this
        week. I’m hoping to pick this up a little more next week, with a
        focus on GCP security work to help me understand the nuances of
        GCP better.</p>
        <p><strong>Projects</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Set up phase 2 of my purple-team home
        lab</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Installed ELK stack with Filebeat to manage my Falco logs
        from GKE Nodes</li>
        <li>Ingesting just Falco logs currently, began looking at the
        available GKE logs collected in GCP Log Explorer - not very
        obvious how to manage these and get them into self-hosted
        Elastic SIEM!</li>
        <li>Next phase will likely be to filter security-relevant API
        server logs from Log Explorer and forward these to Elastic via
        some Pub/Sub topics</li>
        <li>Issue faced that I still haven’t resolved is with setting up
        TLS certificates within ELK - ended up pivoting from fixing this
        into looking at self-signed TLS certificate attacks… rabbit
        holes rabbit holes</li>

        Issues with Self-Signed SSL Certificates</a></strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Good overview of the main 2 methods of performing
        adversary-in-the-middle attacks in networks where self-signed
        TLS certificates are in use</li>
        <li>Would be interesting to find similar attack methodologies
        for abuse in Kubernetes clusters</li>

	RDP with Seth - Adrian Vollmer</a></b></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Interesting talk on the SETH open-source tool for RDP
        eavesdropping</li>
        <li>Don’t really work much with Windows so was nice to
        understand some of the authentication methods and their
        vulnerabilities (e.g. pass-the-hash through NTLM and
        Kerberos)</li>
        <li>Whole reason I watched this was to better understand attacks
        against self-signed TLS certificates</li>
