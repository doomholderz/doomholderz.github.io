        <p><strong>Projects</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Started work on <a
        href="https://github.com/doomholderz/k8seccomp">k8seccomp</a> -
        a CLI tool for building and managing Linux security module
        profiles in Kubernetes</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>auto-seccomp-profile</code> will attach a tracer to
        the running processes of a Kubernetes pod, log all system calls
        the containers makes, and dynamically generates a custom SecComp
        profile for the Pod</li>
        <li><code>deploy-seccomp-profile</code> to make it easy to
        deploy profiles to Pods. Issue is the Pod needs the profile on
        any of the Nodes it can run on, so this automates the process to
        deploy to one or many Nodes in the cluster</li>
        <li><code>validate-apparmor-profile</code> is a bit misplaced
        now (needs its own repo) but will validate an AppArmor profile
        and shout if there’s anti-patterns in use (e.g. write access to
        wildcarded resources)</li>
	</ul></li><br>
        <li><p><strong>Worked on my <a
        href="https://doomholderz.com/blogs/intro_pragmatic_container_security_guide.html">Guide
        to Pragmatic Container Security</a></strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>This is my first foray into writing a security guide, wanted
        to focus on something I’m actively working with at the
        moment</li>
        <li>Aiming for this to be a purely pragmatic and practical
        approach, so ensuring the attacks we care about are outlined in
        each domain of the guide, how the controls actively mitigate the
        risk associated with these attacks, and further steps that can
        be taken to mature these controls</li>
        <li>Focusing on the Runtime Security section of the guide
        (hopefully will have this ready to release next week!)</li>
        <li>Limiting factor right now is having my own fully-fledged K8s
        cluster to work on so I can screenshot how to implement some of
        these recommendations (foreboding…)</li>
	</ul></li><br>
        <li><p><strong>Trials and tribulations of setting up my own
        Kubernetes cluster</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Wanted my own persistent cluster to help with some of the
        projects I’m working on (e.g. k8seccomp tool, container security
        guide)</li>
        <li>Tried kind and minikube, but as both manage K8s pods as
        nested container it did not work well when messing with the
        kernel (and more importantly did not emulate production-grade
        K8s clusters)</li>
        <li>Working now on deploying a rough-and-ready cluster in
        GCP</li>
        </ul></li>
	</ul><br>
        <p><strong>Articles and Videos</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong><code>&lt;article&gt;</code> <a
        href="https://grahamhelton.com/blog/k8slogs/">A Guide to
        Kubernetes Logs that Isn’t a Vendor Pitch</a></strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>This is a rundown of all of the security logs available for
        a service running in a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster, by Graham
        Helton (one of the best security article writers about right
        now)</li>
        <li>Utilises the <code>Kuburrito</code> model for breaking down
        the layers of logs available to monitor a cloud-cluster deployed
        app, with an emphasis on <code>AuditPolicy</code> logs being the
        killer source for security monitoring</li>
	</ul></li><br>
        <li><p><strong><code>&lt;video&gt;</code> <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFrGhodqC08">The cloud is
        over-engineered and overpriced</a></strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>While I don’t necessarily agree with everything said in the
        video (horizontal scaling and database management just
        <em>is</em> easier in the cloud) it’s a pretty good
        pause-for-thought on the delta between self-hosting and
        cloud-hosting</li>
	</ul></li><br>
        <li><p><strong><code>&lt;article&gt;</code> <a
        href="https://www.sumologic.com/blog/threat-labs-kubernetes-home-lab/">Building
        a Kubernetes purple teaming lab</a></strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>This was an article about setting up a simple local minikube
        cluster with basic telemetry feeding into Sumo Logic</li>
        <li>I was hoping for a little more of an in-depth runthrough of
        how to build a fully-fledged ‘purple team’ lab, but this is a
        nice intro</li>
        <li>Would like to write my own guide for achieving this in the
        future, focusing on actual multi-node clusters and
        emulating/detecting attacks exploiting real vulnerabilities in
        containers and Kubernetes</li>
	</ul></li><br>
        <li><p><strong><code>&lt;article&gt;</code> <a
        href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/attackers-deploying-new-tactics-in-campaign-targeting-exposed-docker-apis/">Attackers
        deploying new tactics in campaign targeting exposed Docker
        APIs</a></strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Persistence go brrr, really interesting overview of a new
        cryptojacking campaign targeting publicly-exposed Docker engines
        (tut tut)</li>
        <li>When I have more time I’d love to go through and highlight
        each area of the attack against logs that <em>could</em> be
        available, the folks running this campaign don’t seem to mind
        being fairly noisy so this seems like a great opportunity for
        layered detection rules</li>
	</ul></li><br>
        <li><p><strong><code>&lt;article&gt;</code> <a
        href="https://pulse.latio.tech/p/wtf-is-cdr-part-13">WTF is
        CDR?</a></strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Very entertaining and insightful article by James Berthoty
        on laying out exactly what a Cloud Detection &amp; Response tool
        <em>actually</em> looks like, and how the industry has become
        hyper-fixated on ‘total cloud coverage’ to the detriment of
        actual cloud workload protection</li>
        <li>In the article James argues that for the majority of
        companies, CDR should be just the culmination of Kubernetes API
        logs, container logs, and cloud logs</li>
        <li>Seems like another case of vendors being unable (or
        unwilling) to see the wood for the trees, bolstered by an
        industry that is more obsessed with perceived ‘coverage’ than
        actionable insights</li>
        </ul></li>
