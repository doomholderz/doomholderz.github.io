July 14th</h1>
<p><strong>Quick roundup of the ~security~ stuff I’ve been
working on in the past week!</strong></p>
<p>Getting rid of the CSS this week, hate setting it up and this looks so much cooler</p>

<p><strong>Album of the week:</strong></p>

<li><a

- Third</a> exceeded any expectations I had of what post-Dummy
Portishead would be like. Way more interesting than I expected, and no
song has pulled the carpet from underneath me more than Silence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Article of the week:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://blog.marcolancini.it/2022/blog-cloud-security-infrastructure-review/">Marco
Lancini’s ‘What to look for when reviewing a company’s
infrastructure’</a> is one of the most incredibly methodical and
pragmatic design review approaches I’ve ever read. As a security
engineer that will soon be having to review a lot of brand new
infrastructure (...) this guide will likely be my north star
for how to approach this systematically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purchase of the week:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I respect the fuck out of consumer tech that solves one problem
really well, and in my conscious efforts this year to untether myself
from my phone and computer I’ve purchased a second-hand iPod Nano. This
thing is the shit, haven’t listened to so much new music in months

<h2>Week Roundup</h2>
<p>This was another unbelievably hectic but exciting week, and with mounting pressure in my current role I've not had as much free time to work on personal projects. Nonetheless I've got to read some interesting articles, and work on one cool project that should set me up well for future security adventures!</p>
<p><strong>Projects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Writing up a personal infrastructure design review
process for GCP environments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Off the back of Marco Lancini’s <a
href="https://blog.marcolancini.it/2022/blog-cloud-security-infrastructure-review/">infrastructure
review guide</a> I’ve been working to build out my own personal approach
that granularly reviews GCP infrastructure environments.</li>
<li>For the most part this has been an exercise in identifying all of
the GCP services available to a. secure cloud services, b. secure
workloads, and c. assess the security of the cloud holistically</li>
<li>There’s a lot of other blogs available in this area that it would be
good to spend time with to enrich this approach</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Articles and Videos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>&lt;article&gt;</code> <a

<ul>
<li>Nothing more to add than what’s already said, just a great
guide</li>
</ul></li>

Client-Side Path Traversal to Perform Cross-Site Request
Forgery</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is such a niche attack I love it, plus CSPT2CSRF looks
badass</li>
<li>The <a
href="https://www.doyensec.com/resources/Doyensec_CSPT2CSRF_OWASP_Appsec_Lisbon.pdf">slide
deck</a> for the presentation by Maxence Schmitt at OWASP AppSec in
Lisbon helps to flesh out exactly how this attack works</li>
<li>Really want to go hunting for some CSPT’s now</li>
</ul></li>

Compromised Cookies at Slack</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Idea of monitoring for last access timestamp in a presented cookie
is really cool, goes beyond the technical and actually considers how an
attacker would practically use a stolen cookie</li>
<li>Given the propensity of false-positives, I’m interested to see how
this could rollout with invalidating sessions marked as potentially
forked</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>&lt;tool&gt;</code> <a

<ul>
<li>This is a cool open-source tool for detecting vulnerable domain
records in GCP</li>
<li>Need to learn more about subdomain delegations and how takeovers can
occur for these</li>
</ul></li>

Threat Landscape by Wiz</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nice little database of cloud security measures to prevent attacks
in the cloud</li>
<li>Links off really well to the <a
href="https://d3fend.mitre.org/">MITRE D3FEND</a> matrix</li>
<li>Would be good to spend some time with this and the cloud security
review process I’m building to start some heatmapping around the D3FEND
matrix</li>
</ul></li>
